# Exercise 5: Create an inner function to calculate 
# the addition in the following way

# Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b
# Create an inner function inside an outer function that will
#  calculate the addition of a and b
# At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it

# def outer_fun(a, b):
#     square = a ** 2
#     # inner function
#     def addition(a, b):
#         return a + b
#     # call inner function from outer function
#     add = addition(a, b)
#     # add 5 to the result
#     return add + 5
# result = outer_fun(5, 10)
# print(result)

# Generate a Python list of all the even numbers between 4 to 30
# output expected=[4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28]

# def even():
#     i=0
#     k=[]
#     while i<=n:
#         if i%2==0:
#             k.append(i)
#         i+=1
#     print(k)
# n=int(input("enter"))
# even()
